# R Codes For Machine Learning

##  ... In Progress

### Content

1.) Data Preprocessing Techniques(Missing Values, factorencoding, feature scaling, spliting data in train and test set)  
  
2.) Simple Linear Regression Techniques(Data allocation, Spliting data in train and test set, Linear Regression fitting, plotting training and test prediction)  
  
3.) Multiple_Linear_Regression(Including multiple independent variables to build multiple linear regression model to predict response variable by including BACKWARD ELIMINATION METHOD)  
  
3.1) Automated backward elmination Multiple_Linear_Regression Code  
  
4.) Polynomial_Linear_Regression in R (Bulding a bluffing detector to detect the new employee bluffing on his mention salary with last employer, techniques for high resolution and smoother curve, imaginery grid for position levels)  
  
5.) Support_Vector_Regression --- Using SVR with eps-regression technique, Library used - e1071, Inverse transformation to get result without feature scaling (i.e in original data type)  
  
6.) Decision_Tree_Regression ---- (splitting into leaves, recommending a best suit, showing a 1 dimension decision which turn into worst, High resolution tuning, printing the leaves)  
 Â 
7.) Random Forest Regression ---- (Building RFR model and tuning its performance by increasing number of Decision Trees)
